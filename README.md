6/25/25

* Updated quicksheet to reflect recent classification changes within the IPG. No functional changes.



5/30/25

* Missed triggers reclassified to be warnings. They will still only escalate when in excess as a (repeated) Failure To Maintain Gamestate. This change is more reflective of how tracking missed triggers is handled internally since "no warning" is not easily tracked, even if a verbal mention was made to a player. This label will help policing and facilitate escalation when needed for significant player negligence. This section will also receive a rework in philosophy with more clarity and definition, particularly regarding the "default state" of missed triggers, assumptions players should play under, and a revised process for when a trigger is missed.
* Failure To Maintain Gamestate (FTM): An earlier version of the document had the line mentioning that failure to track opponent triggers would not be classified as a penalty under this, and it was intended that it was mainly to serve optional ("may") triggers while it was expected mandatory (non-optional) triggers were tracked to each players best abilities to keep the game fair, while failure to do so was a FTM error. This line will be brought back and enforced such that not being aware of the opponent triggers won't be penalized for FTM. It will also not be seen under a context of cheating; players aren't obligated to help opponents and should be playing with the assumption that triggers aren't missed by default (especially at high levels of play, e.g., premier events).
* Other change: Formatting has been revised to the infractions such that each category will host a Minor and Major infraction policy division. This serves to further weigh each infraction differently and allows different styles of escalation apart from the base penalty and the potential upgrades. Mostly, this will introduce a suggested pace of escalation, as it has not been codified or standardized after how many repeated errors an infraction penalty becomes upgraded.
* This is the largest update the IPG has received, these changes are effective immediately but are also considered as being trialed. As a reminder, IPG is to be a "best practices" document for handling infractions and penalizing players, just as the TRG is a guideline document that does not completely define the most minute aspects of tournament play.



3/14/2025

* Added examples of improper sideboarding [communication](tournament-errors/minor-tournament-errors/communication-policy-violation.md) and potential [slow play](tournament-errors/major-tournament-errors/slow-play.md)/[stalling](unsporting-conduct/stalling.md) during sideboarding to appropriate sections with philosophy definitions expanded.
* Minor fixes in Failure to Maintain

\
3/7/2025

* Fixed various inconsistencies with ruling examples in Failure to Maintain and Communication Policy violations.
* Updated wording on Communication Policy Violations
* Updated Deck Issue section with significant revision/reorganization for clarity.
* Updated section on Bribery, Waging, and Collusion with significant revisions for clarity.
* Minor change in Tardiness section for consistency across tournament enforcement surrounding tardiness (now to 5 minutes being the game loss threshold rather than 3 minutes). This allows up to the maximum given time extension for a tardiness that is only penalized with a warning when not given a game loss.



1/23/2025

* Fixed Deck Issue section regarding failure to de-side to clarify intended ruling guidelines
* Amended procedures and penalties listed under Decklist Issues with additional detailed examples given.
* Added False Start under the IPG.



8/23/2024

* Migrated IPG from hosted PDF to Gitbook
* Bribery/Collusion is now by default a disqualification rather than a match loss
* Added section on "[Variable Enforcement](philosophy/variable-enforcement.md)" with appropriate sections for certain infractions
