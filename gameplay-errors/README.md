# Gameplay Errors

Gameplay errors fall into the category of Comprehensive Rules violations. These kinds of errors may be the most common and are usually unintentional. Judges are encouraged to investigate whether an error of this type might have been made intentionally, which falls into the category of Cheating under Unsporting Conduct.



While gameplay errors often result in either no penalties or just a warning, the third and any subsequent gameplay errors should be met with a Game Loss penalty. In a tournament spanning multiple days, error counts for players will reset each tournament day.
