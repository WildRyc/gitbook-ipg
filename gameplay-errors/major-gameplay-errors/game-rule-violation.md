# Game Rule Violation

**Penalty: Warning**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**



**Definitions and Philosophy:** This Gameplay Error covers most of the situations in which a player errors or fails to follow game procedures and rules. These violations cover violations of the Comprehensive Rules which are not covered by the other errors listed in Gameplay Errors.

These violations are often based on public information concerning the Game State. While these errors may often be simple to fix independently of a judge, consistency of corrective procedure is important and players should rely on Judges for assistance with all Game Rules Violations.



**Corrective Procedures:** Reverting game states, if possible, should be the first consideration regarding any Game Rules Violations. If an errored Game State is easily corrected with minimal game impact by reverting actions taken that resulted in the Game Rules Violation, this should be the first step taken.

Then, if a simple revert is not enough, follow these steps to determine the correct fix:

* If a player forgets to wake up their objects at the start of their turn and it is still the same turn, wake up them.
* If a player did not draw cards, discard cards, recollect cards, or move cards from one zone to another that they were supposed to, the player does so.
* If an object or card was placed into an incorrect zone and the exact card/object is still known publicly, move the card to the appropriate zone if it does not significantly disrupt the game.

If any of these steps create a trigger, the trigger is appropriately generated only if these fixes can be accompanied by a simple revert where the actions that generate those abilities have the correct timing.

Once the game has passed a time where it would be reasonable to expect the opponent of the violating player to also notice the error, the opponent then would have also committed an infraction (most often Failure to Maintain Game State). If the Judge determines that both players are responsible for the violation, they would instead have committed a Game Rules Violation rather than just a Failure to Maintain Game State.\


**Upgrading:** Repeated Game Rules Violations from a player may be upgraded to a Game Loss if deemed appropriate by the judge. Intentional Game Rules Violations are subject to harsher Cheating infractions under Unsporting Conduct.
