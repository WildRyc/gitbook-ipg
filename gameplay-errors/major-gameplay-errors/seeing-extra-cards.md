# Seeing Extra Cards

**Penalty: Warning**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**\


**Definitions and Philosophy:** When a player sees the face or obtains information of a private card they were not supposed to be able to obtain or know while performing an action. The penalty is only applied once per action sequence, regardless of how many extra cards are seen.

Players may sometimes accidentally handle more cards either due to a physical or dexterity error or an error in following game rules. If the extra cards are being seen from a private set of cards (i.e., the main deck) and the cards join together with another private set, such as the hand, the error becomes a Private Card infraction or a Game Rule infraction, depending on the circumstances (see below).



**Corrective Procedures:** The set of cards that are seen which includes the extra seen cards are all shuffled into the random part of the private set that they came from (typically the Main Deck) and the action which would reveal/draw is repeated. Known cards (such as previously arranged cards due to prior Glimpse effects or card arrangement instructions would be placed in their proper locations after the random portion is shuffled.



**Examples:**&#x20;

* After shuffling and presenting a cut/further shuffle, a player sees the bottom card of their deck.
* A player revealing 3 cards accidentally reveals 4 cards instead.
* A player accidentally flips over the top card or top few cards of their deck.
* A player picking up 3 cards from their Main Deck after being instructed to draw 2, but that player has not yet added those cards to their hand nor has seen those cards (they are still hidden from both players).
