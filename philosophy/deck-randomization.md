# Deck Randomization

Some corrective steps will ask that the random section of a deck (which excludes any known cards or card orders on the top, bottom, or any other non-random sections of the deck) be shuffled. In this case, judges are tasked with finding out which parts of the deck that must be manipulated remain random, setting those cards apart from the non-random subsets of cards, shuffling the random portion, and then recombining the non-random portions with the random portion of the deck. Judges should consider any deck manipulation cards or cards with the glimpse mechanic that might have been played before manipulating a deck. As noted in our other rules and regulations documents, a 60-card deck is considered sufficiently randomly shuffled after 7 shuffles.
