# Game State

“Game State” is a term that refers to the current state of a game, including all cards and their locations and properties, tokens, dice, concurrent ongoing effects, turns, and any other trackable or knowable characteristics in a game.

Maintenance of the Game State is a shared responsibility among players in a game to ensure accurate representation of all actions taken and the possible decisions players may make in the future. Failing to maintain the Game State can compromise a game to the point where information that shouldn't have been known is revealed or mistakes resulting from a misrepresented Game State can cascade, making it irreparable. For the sake of tournament integrity, the Game State should be tracked as accurately and consistently as possible.
