# Guide Advisements

For those that familiarize themselves with this document, please keep in mind that this serves as a guide rather a strict end-all-be-all for violation cases and corrective procedures. Tournament staff and judges are expected to use their best judgement in cases where this document is insufficient to maintain tournament integrity. This may result in corrective procedures and escalation or deescalation of penalties that are not described within this document. If such deviations exist, players deserve proper explanations as to the transpired events and what led to deviations and documentation for posterity may help set precedent and inform both future event staff, judges, and future versions of this document.

As with the other documents, we reserve the right to modify this document as needed and without notice. The most current version of the document will always have the most updated changelog to inform what content has been significantly changed, if any.
