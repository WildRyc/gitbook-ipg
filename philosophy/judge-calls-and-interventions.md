# Judge Calls and Interventions

After a Judge Call, the first judge to appear at the call is considered the attending judge. Players cannot ask for a different judge other than the attending judge. Players or any other tournament attendees that made the Judge Call should explain the situation and the reason for the Judge Call to the attending judge. All information should be presented truthfully; attendees may not lie to judges during Judge Calls or investigations. Then, the judge should determine whether an infraction occurred. If an infraction occurred, the judge should explain the infraction, the recommended corrective steps, and then perform those steps.

Some situations rely on private information that might harm match integrity if shared publicly. In these situations, judges should be discreet and investigate the matter with each player privately, if necessary. Players can always request to speak with a judge away from the table. The severity of the infraction can also be the cause of why a judge may speak to a player discretely or in private.

Investigations for Judge Calls may not be recorded by any of the tournament attendees.
