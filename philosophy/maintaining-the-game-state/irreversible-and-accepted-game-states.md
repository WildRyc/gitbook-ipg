# Irreversible and Accepted Game States

When too many actions, effects, or turns have passed from when the Game State originally became errored, a judge may determine that it is too late to revert all actions and events that have led up to the present game state. If the integrity of a game or match has been affected to grant the player most at fault a significant advantage over their opponent, an infraction that led to an irreversible errored Game State may be penalized with a game loss.



In times where it is determined to be too late to reverse an errored Game State, but the error and present Game State have not generated a significant advantage for the player most at fault for the error or infraction, a judge may rule that the Game State is acceptable and the game can continue without reversal or significant corrective procedure.



Irreversible errored Game States happen if not every action and effect can be reverted to repair the Game State to its previously maintained state or if far too many actions dependent upon prior information have been taken. Irreversible errored Game States should never lead to restarting a match or game.
