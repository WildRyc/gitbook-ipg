# Variable Enforcement

Players of Grand Archive do not have the same goals in terms of engaging with the game in tournament settings. Some seek to compete at the highest level while some wish to enjoy the game in a more casual setting. For this reason, tournaments in Grand Archive can be hosted at multiple competitive levels.

This document informs decisions for rules enforcement in the strictest sense to ensure that tournament integrity is preserved over all else. However, we recognize that players that may seek to engage with the game more casually prioritize a good experience and fun. Many violations and mistakes that are "easy" to make and avoid might appear more frequently at lower tiered events, but over-enforcement and policing of these mistakes may detract from the experience.

For these settings (namely, events below the Store Championship and Regional tiers), we have added "Variable Enforcement" suggestions for certain infractions that inform judges and tournament staff in how to more leniently apply infractions and penalties apart from the typical penalties and corrective procedures. This section will be found at the bottom of each infraction type offer an alternative penalty or serve to put a limit on the severity of penalty applied.
