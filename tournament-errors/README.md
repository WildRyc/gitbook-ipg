# Tournament Errors

Tournament Errors fall under the category of violations for the [Tournament Rules and Regulations](https://trg.gatcg.com/) document. If the Judge believes a violation of this document is intentional, a violation under Unsporting Conduct should be considered.

A player might still violate the rules underlined in the aforementioned document in a way not covered under the following infractions. If they do so, the Judge should make the player aware of the proper procedures and protocols and explain them. If repeated or continued violations of the rules continue, Judges are encouraged to investigate further.

Tournament Errors are upgraded to Game Losses from Warnings if a player has already committed a Tournament Error violation of the same type with the count for these penalties being reset daily over the course of multi-day tournaments.
