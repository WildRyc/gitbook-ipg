# Game/Match End Procedures Violation

**Penalty: Match Loss**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**



**Definitions and Philosophy:** When a player or players in a match use an alternative method to the prescribed Match End Procedures denoted in the Tournament Rules and Regulations document for the determination of a winner of a game or match.

The aforementioned section sets in place rules meant to properly determine the outcome of a game/match through the results of having played a properly structured match. Using any other method other than the delineated steps compromises the tournament's integrity. While intentional draws can be achieved through mutual agreement as described in the Tournament Rules and Regulations document, any other method of reaching this match result is not allowed.



**Examples:**&#x20;

* Two players roll a die to determine a winner of a match.
* Two players wish to play an additional game beyond the tournament match structure to determine the winner.
