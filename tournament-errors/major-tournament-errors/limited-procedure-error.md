# Limited Procedure Error

**Penalty: Warning**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**



**Definitions and Philosophy:** A player makes an error concerning draft procedures. These errors include but are not limited to:

* Passing a pack in the wrong direction
* Stacking cards remaining from multiple packs
* Looking inappropriately at another playerâ€™s selections

Draft involves many players opening multiple packs and handling multiple cards. In addition, players might not be making picks and passing cards at the same speed as other players. As a result, there are multiple opportunities during the draft process for an error to occur. These errors can greatly affect the draft procedure, as even one missed pick or extra pick disrupts a draft. Stacking piles of cards accidentally can also disrupt the draft. It is recommended that players make picks in an organized manner and not create a backlog that allows opportunities for errors. Additionally, even accidentally seeing what another player picks disrupts the integrity of the draft process; it is encouraged that players focus on their own cards and picks during the draft process to maintain that integrity.

Communication regarding the draft process for such things as picks or intended direction or strategy falls under an Outside Assistance infraction and would be grounds for an upgrade to a Match Loss, accordingly.



**Upgrading:** A player who fails to observe proper limited procedures continuously can be issued a game loss. On the 3rd violation (or more), it may be considered to remove the player from the limited event.
