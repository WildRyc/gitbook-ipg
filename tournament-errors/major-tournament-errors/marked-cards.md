# Marked Cards

**Penalty: Warning**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**



**Definitions and Philosophy:** When a player has discernable markings on any card or cards such that they are uniquely identifiable from other cards of the same deck (Material or Main). This includes any marks made from writing implements, bends, folds, scratches, indents, or any other potential markings. This includes any cards that are substantially warped to the point of being identifiable from among a set of cards. This violation excludes any decorations or ornamentations that might be a part of a sleeve, as long as those decorations or ornamentations are identically consistent with the other sleeves of the same deck.



**Corrective Procedure:** The offending player would need to replace the card or sleeve that is marked or sleeve their deck with identical sleeves to ensure that no card or cards are identifiable. If a card becomes damaged or marked in the course of a tournament, a Judge can issue a proxy at their discretion. If marked sleeves cannot be replaced, the player has the option to unsleeve all of their cards within that deck to ensure conformity.



**Upgrading:** The inability to replace the marked card/cards will grant the player an opportunity to replace the cards with any number of cards named Refurbish. By extension, this requires modifying the deck list and will incur a Game Loss penalty as a result. Replacements can still be done at a later time without further penalty.

Or, if a Judge believes that a player would be able to use a pattern of markings to gain a significant strategic advantage, the penalty is a Game Loss. Consider a Cheating infraction if instead if the marked pattern is deemed willful.



**Examples:**&#x20;

* A player is using cards from a printing that had slightly thicker cardstock that is obvious through a sleeve.
* A player has markings (visual or physical) on the sleeve of one of their Refurbish cards.
* A player is using a sleeve-less deck where the card back of one Refurbish is noticeably misaligned.
