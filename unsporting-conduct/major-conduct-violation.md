# Major Conduct Violation

**Penalty: Match Loss**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**



**Definitions and Philosophy:** Major Conduct Violations define any actions that a participant takes towards another individual in the tournament venue that can reasonably be expected to make that individual feel threatened, harassed, bullied, frightened, or stalked. Intent or proof of intent is not a requirement of this infraction; people may commit this infraction without the intention to do so or without any malicious intent. Comments or insults owing to nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, etc. would fall under this category. Threats of physical harm (or threatening actions) allow upgrading of this penalty to immediate disqualification.

Tournaments should provide a safe and enjoyable environment for all participants and individuals present, including venue staff or individuals present in any other capacity. Actions that can result in the above feelings transgress the safety and integrity of a tournament setting. As a result, infractions of this nature are treated severely and may be upgraded to disqualification and removal of the offending person from the venue.

Judges reserve the right to interfere in ongoing matches and end the matches if they feel this is needed to properly deal with this infraction. De-escalation should be a primary concern and Judges should approach each situation calmly, making their best effort to not escalate a situation. Judges may instruct a player to follow them to a more private setting to discuss the transgression and assert the need for corrected behavior.

Tournament officials should take all concerns under this class of infraction seriously and investigate them when they appear to not allow for situations to escalate, if possible. If the attending Judge/Judges feels that the offense was insufficient for this category, it may be downgraded to a Minor Conduct Violation.



**Corrective Procedure:** Players must conform to the prescribed behavior remedy of the attending Judge. Judges may apply the penalty for the next match if this infraction was committed at the end of a match.



**Upgrading:** If the player was found to have committed the offending action with malicious intent, repeats the offense, is not seen to be remorseful regarding the infractions, or does not correct their behavior, the participant may be disqualified from the tournament. They may also be removed from the venue at the request of the Tournament Organizer.

Regarding threats of physical harm, if a participant acts in any way which might suggest the threat of, imminent, or enacted physical harm towards another person or their property, that participant can be immediately disqualified from the tournament. The Tournament Organizer can request that they leave the venue.
