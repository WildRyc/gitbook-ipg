# Minor Conduct Violation

**Penalty: Warning**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Minor**\


**Definitions and Philosophy:** A minor conduct infraction typically deals with the general case of disruptive behaviors. This includes but is not limited to:

* Use of excessive profanity
* Insulting other tournament participants (depending on the nature of the insult and the intent, this may be upgraded to a Major Conduct Violation)..
* Not complying with mandated instructions given by a tournament official.
* Inappropriate demands to penalize others.
* Abusing Judge Calls for frivolous issues.
* Obstructing tournament space.
* Impeding tournament procedures.
* Takes destructive actions (e.g. throwing objects in upset).
* Being untidy or disrespectful of common areas including play areas.
* Using vulgar or offensive tournament materials.
* Appealing a Judge Call before the attending Judge has made a ruling.
* Making an intentionally unfair trade with a less experienced/knowledgeable participant.
* Violating any other venue policies.

Tournament participants, as well as any venue staff or auxiliary staff, are deserving of respect and of a safe environment in which they may enjoy their tournament experience. All participants should work together to secure a positive environment for the enjoyment of all in attendance. Judges owe any violators of conduct guidelines an explanation for why their conduct was unacceptable and a chance to fix or change their conduct.

This section only covers general minor sub-classifications of unsporting conduct. All other cases of unsporting conduct listed in this document in following sections are considered major unsporting conduct violations.



**Corrective Procedure:** Players are expected to conform to any prescribed behavior changes by Judges. Failing to do so or further offenses in this category will automatically upgrade the infraction penalty to a Game Loss. Judges reserve the right to determine whether any misconduct fits into this category. Tournament Organizers reserve the right to remove any individual they feel is excessively disruptive to the tournament environment.
