# Theft

**Penalty: Disqualification**

**Infraction Sub-classification: Major**



**Definitions and Philosophy:** This penalty includes theft of any tournament materials including property of another player or attendee, Tournament Organizer, venue, or other persons or entities. Materials related to the tournament environment or required to run the environment include but are not limited to:

* Cards
* Dice
* Sleeves
* Playmats
* Cases/Boxes/Binders/Backpacks
* Currency
* Clothing Items
* Sealed Product
* Furnishings
* Decorations
* Equipment
* Appliances

Theft may be simultaneously present with the destruction of the material, in which case a disqualification is a maximum penalty that may be imposed. If a player finds any lost equipment or any equipment that is unclaimed, those items should be either turned in to the Tournament Organizer station or deliberate and enthusiastic attempts are made to find the owner(s) of the item(s).

As tournaments and the venues in which they are hosted are expected to be a safe environment, all individuals in attendance hold reasonable expectations that their personal property will be protected from theft and/or damage. However, theft in the busy tournament environments unfortunately does occur and tournament participants hold the responsibility to be vigilant about their belongings as much as is reasonably possible. Participants should expect to keep the belongings they brought to the venue and any objects or materials they were given to keep over the course of the event.

Tournament Organizers should take concerns and reports of theft seriously. Judges should assist any attendees concerned for stolen materials, if able.



**Corrective Procedure:** The stolen materials should be returned to their rightful owners, if possible, and the offending individual should be asked to leave by the Tournament Organizer.



**Examples:**&#x20;

* A player steals cards from another player.
* A player steals a table covering or playmat.
* A player finds a lost card or currency bill and keeps it rather than reporting it.
* A player realizes they still have a card from another player but fail to return it or fail to notify a Judge/Tournament Official about the card.
